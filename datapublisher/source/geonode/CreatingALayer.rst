Creating a Layer
################

Layers are a published resource representing a raster or vector spatial data source. Layers also can be associated with metadata, ratings, and comments.

The C-READ GeoNode web interface is the primary method of interacting with C-READ GeoNode as a user. From this interface, one can view and modify existing spatial layers and maps, as well as find information on other C-READ GeoNode users.
Without being logged in, you are limited to read-only access of public layers.

1. Navigate to your C-READ GeoNode instance available in the C-READ GeoNode welcome page. This page shows a variety of information about the C-READ GeoNode instance. At the top of the page is a toolbar showing quick links to view layers, maps, documents (metadata) and a search field. :

2. Click the Layers link in the toolbar to go to the Explore Layers page.
This page shows all layers known to C_READ GeoNode, available in either List or Grid viewing. Layers can be sorted by Most Recent or Most Popular. Also available are a list of categories, with which layers can be connected with.

4. You have two possibilities to add your files. You can either do that by using drag & drop or you choose to browse them. Be aware that you have to upload a complete set of files, consisting of a shp, a prj, a dbf and a shx file. If one of them is missing, C-READ GeoNode will warn you before you upload them.


5. C-READ GeoNode has the ability to restrict who can view, edit, and manage layers. On the right side of the page you can see the Permission section, where you can limit the access on your layer. Under Who can view and download this data, select Any registered user. This will ensure that anonymous view access is disabled. In the same area, under Who can edit this data, select your username. This will ensure that only you are able to edit the data in the layer.
