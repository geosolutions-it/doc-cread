C-READ Security and Permissions
===============================

C-READ app customizes the way permissions and publication steps are dealt with.
 

Permissions and GeoNode objects
===============================

Users
-----

Staff users are not used in C-READ context.

Groups
------

Groups are not used in C-READ context.

Resources
---------

Layers, maps and documents permissions are set so that anyone has the rights to view and download data,
while layer and metadata editing is reserved to the owner (and to admins).


Publishing and unpublishing objects
===================================

In C-READ any new resource is created in the state *unpublished*.

Administrators will be able to view unpublished resources also in the main search page.
Unpublished resources will be clearly marked as such. 

Buttons for (un)publishing the resource wil be shown in the resource details page,
so there is no need to open the administration pages. 

For more information read the section :ref:`cread_publish_resource`.
