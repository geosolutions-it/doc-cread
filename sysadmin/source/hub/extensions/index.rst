CKAN: Extensions
================

Some **core extensions** come packaged with CKAN. Core extensions don't
need to be installed before you can use them as they're installed when you
install CKAN, they can simply be enabled by following the setup
instructions in each extension's documentation (some core extensions are
already enabled by default). For example, this is a list of some of the core extensions:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   datastore 
   filestore   
   multilingual 
   stats 
   data-viewer
   dcat 

This is the CKAN developer guide for creating new extensions:

   :maxdepth: 1
