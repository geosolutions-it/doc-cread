The C-READ GeoNode web interface is the primary method of interacting with C-READ GeoNode as a user. From this interface, one can view and modify existing spatial layers and maps, as well as find information on other C-READ GeoNode users.
Without being logged in, you are limited to read-only access of public layers.

After the update, the layer will display in a preview window.

2. Click the Attributes tab. This lists the attributes of the layer, including statistics (range, average, median and standard deviation). Layer attribute statistics are made available only for numeric attributes. As we can see, this layerâ€™s attributes are not numeric, so no statistics are calculated.
