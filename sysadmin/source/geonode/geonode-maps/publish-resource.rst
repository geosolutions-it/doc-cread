=====================
Publishing a resource
=====================

When a registered user creates a resource (a layer, a map or a document), it is unpublished by default.
This means that such resource can only be viewed by an administrator; regular users will not be able to see it, 
and neither it will be harvested by the hub. 

The administrator will check the quality of the resource, review and amend the metadata if the case,
and then decide to publish it.

In order to publish a resource the administrator has to log-in on the 
http://data.cread.geo-solutions.it/ web-portal with administrative credential and follow the procedure below:

1. Search the unpublished resource. This type of resources are marked as **NOT PUBLISHED** in the main page of the application, 
   as in the figure below.

2. Click on the title of the resource in order to open its details page

3. Select the button **PUBLISH** in the upper right corner of the form

4. Once clicked, the resource will be published and the button will change in **UNPUBLISH**.


In the same way, a published resource can be unpublished by clicking the **UNPUBLISH** button.
