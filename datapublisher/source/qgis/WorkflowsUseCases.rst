Workflows Use Cases introduction
########

In these chapters there are some example workflows developed specifically for this training. 

They address some of the most common use cases: **raster processing** and **data dissemination** through geonode.

Geospatial processing steps performed in these workflows are the optimization of Raster dataset and the Vector datasource features filtering and extraction.
