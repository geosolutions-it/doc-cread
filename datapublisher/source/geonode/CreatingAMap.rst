In C-READ GeoNode System maps are comprised of various layers and their styles. Layers can be both local layers in C-READ GeoNode as well as remote layers either served from other WMS servers or by web service layers such as Google or MapQuest. 
C-READ GeoNode maps also contain other information such as map zoom and extent, layer ordering, and style.
