CKAN: Installation Guide
========================

Before you can use CKAN on your own server, you need to install it. 
There are three ways to install CKAN:

#. Install from an operating system package
#. Install from source
#. Install using a Docker image

Packaging for automatic installation are only provided for Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, so, 
the only option for installing CKAN on a CentOS platform is installing it from source.
