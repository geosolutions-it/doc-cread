Hub: Data Preview
=================

The C-READ hub web interface is the primary method for interacting with the C-READ
system as a user. 
Using this interface, one can search and view the resources registered in the catalog,
such as spatial layers, maps, text documents and gridded data.

In the C-READ context users are limited to read-only access to all the resources, 
since the data ingestion will be performed on the data node, implemented by GeoNode and GeoServer. 

Choose a dataset and click on dataset name.
